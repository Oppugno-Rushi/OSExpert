## 📋 Overview

OSExpert-Eval shows that current computer-use agents remain far from expert-level: they struggle with long-horizon tasks, generalize poorly to unseen UI designs, lack fine-grained control over action sequences, and still fall well short of human expert efficiency.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Long-Horizon compositional workflows** (LibreOffice + GIMP)
- **Unseen UI generalization** (Tableau + MiniWord)
- **Fine-grained action execution** (GIMP + LibreOffice)
- **Efficiency** vs. human experts (time-to-complete)

## 📊 Benchmark Scale

- **113** total tasks
- Long Horizon: **30** tasks
- Unseen UI: **50** tasks
- Fine-Grained: **33** tasks

## 🔬 Method

OSExpert learns verifiable skills from **bottom-up self-exploration** and reuses them for robust, efficient inference:

- **GUI-DFS exploration** to discover and verify unit functions
- **Curriculum construction** by composing unit skills into composite procedures
- **Fine-grained action primitives** discovered during exploration and stored as reusable skills
- **Efficiency** via single-pass fast planning and a **skill-boundary check** for early stopping

## 📈 Results

- **+17%** performance gain on OSExpert-Eval
- **89%** efficiency gap closed to humans
